# IOTA-SC-tracking
Identity of Things (IDoT), the identity management for things, is, considering the fast-growing number of connected devices, an important research topic. An enabling technology for IDoT are Distributed Ledgers: Using Distributed Ledgers should foster the independence of a subject (Self Sovereign Identity â€“ SSI) and thus address data security, data privacy and manipulation possibilities. 

In the supply chain identifying and tracking subjects helps to make processes more traceable and effective.
This app illustrates the concept of a IOTA-based tracking system in the supply chain. 

Visit the app on https://iota-tracking-system.firebaseapp.com.

The following functions could be part of the tracking system:

- Authenticate a tracking device :heavy_check_mark:
- Register a packaging unit in order to track it :heavy_check_mark: 
- Register a freight containing multiple packaging units
- Fetch the tracking data from the tangle and display it :heavy_check_mark:

## Getting started

**Prerequisites**

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- Developer account on [remote.it](https://remote.it/) to connect this app to your Raspberry Pi.

**Installation**

You can download this repo to run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies automatically. 
All dependencies are visible in the package.json file.

Add a .env file with the following content: 
```
VUE_APP_REMOTEIT_DEVELOPER_KEY=[your remoteit developer key]
VUE_APP_REMOTEIT_USERNAME=[your remoteit username]
VUE_APP_REMOTEIT_PASSWORD=[your remoteit password]
VUE_APP_REMOTEIT_DEVICE_ADDRESS=[your remoteit device address] 
VUE_APP_PUBLIC_KEY_DEVICE=[a public key to check the JSON Web token of your iot device]
VUE_APP_SEED=[IOTA seed to register a packaging unit] 
VUE_APP_SIDE_KEY=[IOTA side key to register a packaging unit]
VUE_APP_GNSS_SEED=[IOTA seed to fetch the tracking data]
``` 
The remote.it device address is the service ID of your device visible in your remote.it account.

To generate a seed, run ```cat /dev/urandom |tr -dc A-Z9|head -c${1:-81}```
